# typing course

This project is a typing practice website where users can improve their typing skills by completing given texts under a time limit. As soon as the user starts typing, a 60-second timer begins to count down. The application provides real-time feedback by highlighting correct letters in green and incorrect ones in red, helping users quickly identify mistakes. The platform includes five levels of increasing difficulty, from beginner-friendly texts to advanced challenges.
